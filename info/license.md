=======

Overview
--------

Most source files (those with extension `.rs` or `.glsl`) are covered by Mozilla Public License
version 2. Only those intended to be later published as crates are licensed on MIT license.

For documentation or manuals (in particular for all files with extension `.md` and `.adoc`) any
copyright is dedicated to the
[Public Domain](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

Files describing Wayland protocols (`src/skylane_protocols/*.xml`) are borrowed from Wayland
project. Original copyright applies to them (MIT license).

For list of copyright holders, contributors and other credits see [authors.md](./authors.md).

Rationale
---------

MPL-2.0 was chosen as a license for source files because it is

 * popular and widely used or with strong community (according to
   [OSI](https://opensource.org/licenses/category))

 * approved by FSF and OSI and compatible with GPL

 * file-level - does not impose itself on all files in repository

 * more business-friendly than GPL yet still copyleft
